# A Program Logic for Modular Verification of SPARCv8 Code 

> All the coq implementation is in the direction /coqimp

/coqimp/framework : 
- auxiliary : some auxiliary definitions like integer
- models : the program model including the registers, memory, operational semantics and so on
- logic : assertion definitions and logic rules
- soundness : soundness prove

/coq/example : 
- code : the codes need to be proved
- lib : some tactics and derived rules
- spec : code specifications
- proof : the proofscripts

All of the coqfiles can be compiled by "make filename.vo" individually.

The file paper.pdf is the **technical report**.
